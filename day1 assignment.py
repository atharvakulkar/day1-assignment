5)is python code compiled or interpreted ?
Python is an interpreted language, which means the source code of a Python program is converted into bytecode
that is then executed by the Python virtual machine

get_ipython().set_next_input('6)Name a few blocks of code used to define in Python language');get_ipython().run_line_magic('pinfo', 'language')
Python uses indentation to define blocks of code. Indentations are simply spaces or tabs used as an
indicator that is part of the indent code child.

if (condition):

# Statement 1

else:

# Statement 2

You will find that statements 1 will have the same indentation and therefore is of the same block. And similarly, 
statements 2 is of a another block.

Python can handle plenty of an immense amount of data.

get_ipython().set_next_input('14)How is memory managed in Python');get_ipython().run_line_magic('pinfo', 'Python')
Memory in Python is managed by Python private heap space. All Python objects and data structures are located in a private heap.
This private heap is taken care of by Python Interpreter itself, and a programmer doesn’t have access to this private heap.
Python memory manager takes care of the allocation of Python private heap space. Memory for Python private heap space is made
available by Python’s in-built garbage collector, which recycles and frees up all the unused memory. The allocation of heap 
space for Python objects and other internal buffers is performed on demand by the Python memory manager through the Python/C
API functions listed in this document. To avoid memory corruption, extension writers should never try to operate on Python 
objects with the functions exported by the C library: malloc(), calloc(), realloc() and free().

First, we need to locate where the python is being installed after downloading it. Press WINDOWS key and search for “Python”,
you will get something like this:Click on open file location and you will be in a location where Python is installed, Copy the
    location path from the top by clicking over it. Now, we have to add the above-copied path as a variable so that windows
    can recognize. Search for “Environmental Variables”, you will see something like this: Click on that( Now click the

           get_ipython().set_next_input('           16)is indentation is required for the python');get_ipython().run_line_magic('pinfo', 'python')
Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. Where in other programming languages the indentation 
in code is for readability only, for Python is very important. Python uses indentation to indicate
a block of code
